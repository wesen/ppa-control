- remove fyne stuff

- prototype some UI ideas for the final product

- [/] use gochannel pubsub event driven system for internal updates
  - as a corollary, keep the multi client or not?
  - [/] use oracle/o3 to analyze how to do that
  - removes the need for channel shenanigans with the web  ui

- [/] add glazed to the mix if not present already?

- [x] channel-test/ - Communication channel testing
- [x] wait-for-channel-client/ - Client connection utilities
- delete simulator?

- [ ] make websocket stuff work for the web UI
- fix the websocket stuff for the live web ui

## Experimental ideas

- make a REPL for testing
