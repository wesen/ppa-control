- remove fyne stuff
- fix the websocket stuff for the live web ui
- prototype some UI ideas for the final product

- use gochannel pubsub event driven system for internal updates
  - as a corollary, keep the multi client or not?
  - use oracle/o3 to analyze how to do that
  - removes the need for channel shenanigans with the web  ui

- add glazed to the mix if not present already?

- delete this: ? 

channel-test/ - Communication channel testing
wait-for-channel-client/ - Client connection utilities
simulator?


## Experimental ideas

- make a REPL for testing
