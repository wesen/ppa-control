Today, I'm building the functionality for a user to upload logfiles
to help me with debugging. As usual, I am doing this "right", so I'm
actually building a full package called "bucheron" to upload logs and
send out notifications to the developer per email.

I have been asking ChatGPT for a lot of example code and it's looking pretty
good. Here are however a few blog posts that give some actual human guidelines
on how to build and deploy lambdas using terraform that are useful to
countercheck:

To securely get upload token, this seems to be the recommended way
using STS (note how the article is from 2010):
