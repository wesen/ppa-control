Apparently, ppa-control can recognize 4 speakers with link-local 
addresses (169.254.x.x), but was then unable to switch presets, despite
having recognized them (it actually switched presets on one of them).

I'm not sure what the issue here might be, and I think the best way to debug this
is to collect a debug log file that simon can then send me, instead of relying on
UI output and screenshots.

That way I might be able to add additional output in there and will have no need
to ask to repeatedly run command line tools.

## Fighting with golangci-lint

I had trouble running golangci-lint because somehow when running the docker image
it is now failing to "extract data" for gopacket, which I suspect is because
libpcap-dev might not be installed on the lint docker image.

I spent far too long dealing with this, and because it runs fine with the macosx
local golangci-lint and I have lefthook hooks enabled, I will leave it for now.

It did catch a few race conditions on waitgroups being added inside a goroutine instead
of upfront before launching it, so I'm glad I still put some effort into it.

I wonder why it didn't catch on previous builds, but it might have?

## Adding lumberjack support

Since I'm going to create random logfiles on a user's computer, I'm going 
to make sure they get rotated to avoid filling up their harddrives, Especially
if they let the programs run for longer periods of time.

## OS specific settings

While I'm at it, I'm looking at ways of storing cross-platform config files,
more out of pedantry really, since we currently focus on OSX:

## Uploading log file at the end of a run

one thing I could do to make things a bit easier is to have an automatic upload 
of the log file at the end of a session. I wonder what the best way to set this up
would be however. Just a simple AWS lambda maybe? A straight call to S3 with some embedded 
keys in the app?
